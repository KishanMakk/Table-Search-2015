# Table Search 2015
iOS 9 project demonstrating how to create a searchable UITableView

I've built this code 4-part screencast: 

 * Part 1 will talk you through how to build a UITableView with dummy data
 * In Part 2 I'll show you how to use a UISearchController to display a second table view
 * In Part 3 we'll discuss how to filter results using an NSPredicate
 * And in Part 4 we'll see how to communicate those search results to the second table view via KVO.

The whole course is about 50 minutes long, and I'll explain details step by step. Part 1 is free, and the remainder of the course is available to members of my iOS Dev Diary website. All code is Objective-C, and the code is available as a demo project on GitHub.
